# ERC20 Token Creation and Crowd Sale

ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The primary difference is that instead of running on their own blockchain, ERC-20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum network.

Utilising the Truffle framework to test and deploy the token, this repo also contains a rudimentary front end, built with React, that allows users to 'buy' tokens in a crowd sale fashion, reminiscent of the infamous 2017/18 ICO era.

Unit tests of the Smart Contracts, written in Solidity, were performed using JavaScript with Mocha and Chai. These can be found in the /test directory. Said contracts were deployed to Truffle‚Äôs local development network before being deployed and tested on the Ropsten and Goerli networks.






### Real-World Use-Cases


üí∞ Tokenization of any assets as fungible tokens (ERC20)

üè¶ Creation of bonus programs, vouchers, etc

üí≤ Creation of a new crypto currency

üßæ Creation of a payment-layer on top of Ethereum


### Development-Goals


üß∞ Develop deeper understanding of truffle-config files

ü§ñ Understand deployment of dApps

ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Understand tokenization using Open-Zeppelin Smart Contracts

‚òëÔ∏è Deep dive into unit-testing

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Enter the inital token supply and your wallet mnemonic in the env file
  ```sh
   INITIAL_TOKENS=
   MNEMONIC=
  ```
   
2. If looking to deploy on ETH test networks or main net then enter the relevant URL path for your web3 connection in the truffle-config.js file ([Infura](https://infura.io/) was used for this project)
  ```JS
    // Ethereum network of choice e.g:
    ropsten_infura: {
      provider: function() {
        return new HDWalletProvider(process.env.MNEMONIC, "INSERT Web3 PROVIDER ADDRESS HERE", AccountIndex)
      },
      network_id: 3
    }
   ```
   
3. To run the front end locally (at http://localhost:3000), ensure you are in the "client" directory and use a terminal to execute the following
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

</p>

4. Changing the token's name and ticker can be acheived through editing MyToken.sol in /contracts (don't forget to update the front end too!)
  ```sol
  constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20Detailed("Azure","AZE", 0) public {
  ```
  
5. Changes to the front end can be made by editing the App.js file found in /client/src
